# Automated Jenkins Deployment with Helm

This automated Jenkins deployment with Helm creates a namespace, service, serviceAccount, volume, and a deployment for Jenkins to run on a Kubernetes cluster. The deployment uses Helm charts, and all of the values are embedded into the values file. This makes the deployment process more efficient and repeatable.

### The following steps are involved in the deployment process:
<ul>
    <li><b>Create a namespace for Jenkins:</b> A namespace is a logical grouping of Kubernetes resources. By creating a namespace for Jenkins, you can isolate it from other applications running on the Kubernetes cluster.
    <li><b>Create a service account for Jenkins:</b> A service account is a Kubernetes object that allows applications to access Kubernetes resources. By creating a service account for Jenkins, you can grant it the permissions it needs to access the Kubernetes cluster.
    <li><b>Create a volume for Jenkins:</b> A volume is a persistent storage area for Kubernetes data. By creating a volume for Jenkins, you can ensure that its data is not lost if the Jenkins pod is restarted.
    <li><b>Create a deployment for Jenkins:</b> A deployment is a Kubernetes object that manages the creation and scaling of pods. By creating a deployment for Jenkins, you can ensure that Jenkins is always running on the Kubernetes cluster.
    <li><b>Deploy Jenkins to the Kubernetes cluster:</b> Once you have created the namespace, service account, volume, and deployment, you can deploy Jenkins to the Kubernetes cluster by running the following command:
</ul>

### The following are some of the benefits of using this automated deployment process:
<ul>
    <li><b>Efficiency:</b> The deployment process is more efficient because it uses Helm charts and all of the values are embedded into the values file. This eliminates the need to manually create the Kubernetes resources.
    <li><b>Repeatability:</b> The deployment process is more repeatable because it uses Helm charts. This makes it easier to deploy Jenkins to new Kubernetes clusters.
    <li><b>Flexibility:</b> The deployment process is more flexible because it uses Helm charts. This allows you to customize the deployment to meet your specific needs.
</ul>

If you are looking for an efficient, repeatable, and flexible way to deploy Jenkins to a Kubernetes cluster, then this automated deployment process is a good option.
